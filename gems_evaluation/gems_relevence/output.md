## Octahedral Growth

Octahedral growth refers to a specific way that crystals, including gemstones, develop their shape. This growth pattern is characterized by the crystal forming with eight faces, creating an octahedron—a shape with eight triangular sides. This pattern is common in various minerals and gems and gives them their unique appearance and properties.


### Gemstone Classification

Octahedral growth is categorized into two main types: natural octahedral growth and synthetic octahedral growth. Natural octahedral growth occurs in the Earth's mantle, where high pressure and temperature conditions lead to the formation of carbon atoms into octahedral-shaped diamond crystals. For example, diamonds from the Marange fields in Zimbabwe[12] and Siberian diamonds[13] are natural octahedral crystals. On the other hand, synthetic octahedral growth is achieved in laboratory settings by replicating the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions found in nature. Techniques such as HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature are used to produce diamond crystals with controlled properties in a controlled environment 


### Sources of Gemstones

The octahedral growth of crystals was first identified in natural diamonds, which exhibit a characteristic octahedral shape with multiple flat faces. This growth pattern was discovered in diamond deposits found in natural sources, such as in the mantle of the Earth[14]. Significant deposits of octahedral diamonds have been located in regions like Minas Gerais, Brazil[15],  Marange, and Zimbabwe[12]. These discoveries have provided geologists with insights into the natural processes that create diamonds and their unique crystal structures. In laboratory settings, the development of techniques like High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) has allowed for the controlled synthesis of octahedral diamonds, mimicking natural conditions to produce high-quality crystals with precise characteristics[16].


### Geological Formation Conditions

Octahedral growth typically occurs in environments where there is extremely high pressure and temperature, such as deep within the Earth's mantle. Diamonds, which commonly exhibit octahedral growth, form about 140 to 190 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface. This environment provides the right conditions for carbon atoms to arrange themselves into octahedral shapes.

In the Earth's mantle, carbon atoms bond together in a crystal structure that forms an octahedron. This process happens because of the immense pressure (over 45,000 atmospheres) and high temperatures (between 900°C to 1,300°C). For instance, diamonds found in the Kimberlite pipes of South Africa[17] and the diamond mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo[18] have octahedral shapes due to these specific geological conditions.

In addition to natural formation, synthetic diamonds can also be created using similar conditions in laboratories. Scientists use machines that mimic the high pressure and high temperature of the Earth's mantle to grow diamonds in a controlled environment[15].


### Processes of Gemstone Formation

High Pressure The Earth's mantle exerts pressures that are over 45,000 times the atmospheric pressure at the surface. This immense pressure is essential for the carbon atoms to bond and form strong and stable crystals[19].

High Temperature The temperatures in the mantle range from 900°C to 1,300°C. Such high temperatures enable the carbon atoms to move and arrange themselves into a precise and ordered crystal lattice, forming the octahedral structure[20].

Magma Movement The movement of magma within the mantle helps transport carbon to regions where high pressure and temperature conditions are favorable for diamond formation. These movements can eventually bring diamonds closer to the Earth's surface through volcanic pipes known as Kimberlite pipes, which are magma conduits that transport diamonds and other mantle materials to the surface[21].

Laboratory Conditions Besides natural formation, octahedral diamond growth can be replicated in laboratory settings using High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) methods. These methods mimic the natural high pressure and high temperature conditions of the mantle, allowing scientists to create synthetic diamonds with similar properties to natural ones[16].


### Factors Influencing Gemstone Formation

High pressure is crucial, as it compacts carbon atoms tightly together, enabling them to bond and form a crystal structure. The pressure in the mantle can be over 45,000 times that of the Earth's surface, which is necessary for diamond stability and growth. Secondly, 

High temperature is essential for allowing carbon atoms to move and rearrange into the octahedral structure. Temperatures in the mantle typically range from 900°C to 1,300°C, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon atoms into a crystalline lattice. Additionally, the 

Presence of carbon-rich fluids or melts in the mantle plays a significant role. These fluids provide the carbon atoms needed for diamond formation. Lastly, 

Time is a critical factor; diamonds can take millions of years to form under these conditions, slowly growing as carbon atoms continue to add to the crystal lattice. These combined factors create the unique conditions necessary for the growth of octahedral diamonds, making them rare and valuable.


### Properties

	Diamonds with octahedral growth have several distinctive properties. Firstly, their crystal structure forms an eight-faced shape called an octahedron, which gives the diamond its symmetrical and unique beauty[14]. These diamonds often have high purity because the growth process occurs in environments with high pressure and temperature, which minimizes the occurrence of internal fractures and impurities[21]. Additionally, octahedral diamonds are extremely hard, being the hardest natural material known, making them highly resistant to scratches[22]. These properties make octahedral growth diamonds highly sought after in the jewelry industry and valuable in the market.


### Analysis and Evaluation

	The analysis and examination of diamonds with octahedral growth involve several advanced techniques to determine their quality and authenticity. One common method is using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which helps identify the types of impurities and defects within the diamond by measuring how the diamond absorbs infrared light[14]. Another technique is Raman spectroscopy, which uses laser light to provide information about the crystal structure and any internal stresses or inclusions[23]. Additionally, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy can be used to study the luminescent properties of the diamond, revealing details about its formation environment and any treatments it may have undergone[14]. These methods are crucial for gemologists to accurately evaluate the diamonds, ensuring they are genuine and understanding their unique properties.


### Conclusion

Octahedral growth is a fascinating aspect of gemstone formation, influencing both their appearance and properties. Understanding this growth pattern helps gemologists and enthusiasts appreciate the natural beauty of these crystals and their unique formation conditions. The study of gemstones like diamonds and spinels reveals the complex processes and factors that contribute to their development and value.

## Nacre

Nacre, commonly known as "mother of pearl," is a natural substance found in the shells of certain mollusks and in the pearls they produce. It is composed of thin layers of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite and a protein called conchiolin [91]. Nacre is renowned for its iridescent luster and range of colors, making it highly valued in the jewelry industry.


### Sources and Discovery

The formation of nacre begins with a process called biomineralization, a biological process where mollusks produce minerals and proteins to create nacre. The primary steps of this process include

Introduction of Foreign Particles
When foreign particles such as sand grains or parasites enter the mollusk, they stimulate the mollusk to produce nacre to encase the irritant. The mollusk responds by secreting layers of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and conchiolin .

Formation of Calcium Carbonate Layers
The mollusk begins to form thin layers of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite. These layers are arranged in sheets, with conchiolin acting as a "mortar" to bind the aragonite sheets together. The conchiolin is produced as a sticky and flexible gel, allowing the aragonite sheets to be tightly packed [91].

Growth of Nacre
The production of nacre continues over several years as the mollusk adds layers of calcium carbonate and protein, making the nacre thicker and more robust. This growth occurs in a stepwise manner, with each step creating thin, lustrous layers that contribute to the beauty and durability of nacre.

Light Reflection and Refraction
Nacre's iridescent luster and varied colors are due to the reflection and refraction of light through the calcium carbonate layers. Each layer acts as a mirror, reflecting light and creating beautiful color play, such as the rainbow hues seen in pearls [92]


### Properties

Chemical Properties

Nacre consists of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of aragonite, organized into thin layers. In addition to calcium carbonate, nacre contains conchiolin, a protein that acts as a binding agent between the aragonite layers. This protein is sticky and flexible, giving nacre its strength and durability. The complex structure of nacre, composed of aragonite layers and conchiolin, helps in reflecting and refracting light, resulting in its unique luster and colors [93].

Physical Properties

Nacre's physical properties make it a beautiful and durable material. The primary component of nacre is thin layers of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite, arranged to create iridescent luster and varied colors. These layers are transparent and bonded by the flexible conchiolin protein, providing nacre with strength and impact resistance. The "brick-and-mortar" structure of nacre disperses impact forces, preventing it from breaking easily and enhancing its wear resistance. Additionally, nacre's ability to reflect and refract light creates a unique color play, such as the iridescent hues seen from different angles [94].[92,94]


### Types

Pearls, which are a product of nacre, can be classified into several types based on their formation. Generally, they are divided into two main categories: natural pearls and cultured pearls, with further subdivisions based on cultivation methods.

Natural Pearls
	Natural pearls form when foreign objects like sand grains or parasites enter a mollusk. The mollusk's immune system responds by secreting layers of calcium carbonate (aragonite) and conchiolin to coat the object. These layers accumulate to form a smooth, round pearl. Natural pearls can be found in three main types:

Saltwater Pearls Produced by mollusks in the sea, these pearls vary in characteristics based on the mollusk species.

Freshwater Pearls Found in mollusks living in freshwater sources such as rivers and lakes.

Blister Pearls Formed when a pearl grows attached to the mollusk's shell, resulting in a hemispherical or oval shape [95–98].

Cultured Pearls
	Cultured pearls are created through human intervention by inserting a foreign object into a mollusk under controlled conditions. They can be categorized into

Bead-Cultured Pearls Created by inserting a bead made from shell and a piece of tissue into the mollusk, which then secretes layers of aragonite and conchiolin over the bead.

Freshwater Cultured Pearls Made by inserting a piece of tissue into freshwater mollusks without using a bead, leading the mollusk to produce aragonite and conchiolin layers around the tissue.

Blister Pearls Formed by attaching a foreign object to the shell wall, which the mollusk then covers with layers of aragonite and conchiolin. 


### Maintenance

Proper care is essential to maintain the quality and luster of nacre. Pearls are sensitive to chemicals like perfumes, soaps, hair sprays, and cleaning agents, which can damage their surface. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid exposing pearls to these substances. Cleaning pearls should be done gently using a soft, damp cloth to remove sweat and dirt after wearing them. Storing pearls in a slightly humid environment, such as a fabric-lined jewelry box, helps prevent them from drying out. It is also important to avoid storing pearls in high temperatures or direct sunlight, as heat and light can cause them to become brittle and crack [99].


### Examination and Analysis

The examination and analysis of nacre involve advanced technology to study its structure and properties. Scientists use various techniques, such as structural color analysis, to investigate the detailed arrangement of calcium carbonate and conchiolin layers in nacre. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides high-resolution images of the microstructure. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze the chemical composition and arrangement of aragonite crystals. These analyses help us understand the formation and growth of nacre, as well as its physical properties that contribute to its luster and durability [91].

Etch Channels form when the crystal structure of diamonds or other gemstones is dissolved by corrosive fluids or gases, which can occur during or after the crystal's growth. These channels can result from the infiltration of radiation-bearing fluids that cause dissolution and create channels or pits within the crystal.[170] In some cases, high acidity or alkalinity in water can dissolve the crystal under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, resulting in Etch Channels with various shapes and sizes, such as triangular channels known as trigons.[171] Etch Channels may also form through natural processes, such as the action of fluids that dissolve the crystal while it is deep within the Earth's crust,[8] or through biological processes, such as parasites burrowing into a pearl and creating pathways. Additionally, human activities like the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process used to create synthetic diamonds can result in unique Etch Channels that differ from natural ones[172]


### Types

Trigons These are triangular-shaped Etch Channels commonly found on the surface of diamonds, especially on octahedral faces. Trigons are formed due to the dissolution of the diamond crystal in a triangular pattern[171]

Worm-like Structures These channels resemble worm trails and are found in heavily etched diamonds. They result from irregular dissolution processes that create winding, snake-like channels[8]

Y-shaped Channels These channels have a Y-shape and are formed by the action of parasites in pearls. The parasites burrow into the crystal, creating branched pathways that resemble the letter Y.

Rectangular Channels These are rectangular-shaped channels that can be found in certain types of diamonds. These channels often form along the crystal structure's natural lines of weakness.[13]

Network of Etch Channels This type consists of interconnected channels that create complex and systematic patterns. These networks form due to prolonged and continuous dissolution processes, resulting in intricate structures.[173]


### Examination and Analysis

Raman Spectroscopy This technique uses laser light to study the chemical structure and composition of gemstones. It helps identify the substances within Etch Channels and understand how they form. For example, Raman Spectroscopy was used to examine xenotime inclusions in diamonds.

X-ray Computed Microtomography (μ-CT) This technique uses X-rays to create three-dimensional images of the internal structure of gemstones. It allows us to see Etch Channels inside diamonds and other gemstones clearly and in detail. For instance, μ-CT was used to examine the internal structure of the Matryoshka diamond[13]

Photoluminescence Spectroscopy: This technique uses light to analyze the luminescence properties of gemstones. It helps detect radiation-induced defects in Etch Channels. For example, Photoluminescence Spectroscopy was used to examine radiation defects in diamonds[170]

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) This technique uses a beam of electrons to produce high-resolution images of the gemstone surface. It allows for detailed examination of the structure and shape of Etch Channels. For example, SEM was used to study Etch Channels in diamonds created by the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process.[172]

Infrared Spectroscopy This technique uses infrared light to analyze the chemical composition and structure of gemstones. It helps identify the substances and chemical changes in Etch Channels. For instance, Infrared Spectroscopy was used to study diamonds with Etch Channels.[173]


### Effects on Gemstone Properties

Clarity and Appearance Large or numerous Etch Channels can make a diamond appear cloudy and reduce its overall beauty. These channels can be visible to the naked eye or under a microscope, reducing the diamond's value and appeal. For instance, diamonds with extensive networks of Etch Channels often have lower clarity grades.[8]

Strength Etch Channels that form within diamonds can weaken their structure, making them more brittle and prone to breakage. Diamonds with numerous Etch Channels may have reduced strength and be more susceptible to damage.[8]

Chemical Properties Etch Channels can accumulate non-diamond materials, leading to changes in chemical properties. For example, radiation stains caused by radioactive fluids can alter the diamond's color and create chemical defects. Such changes can be identified and analyzed using advanced spectroscopy techniques.[170]


### Conclusion

Etch Channels are grooves or cavities that form from the dissolution processes of crystals in diamonds or other gemstones. There are various types of Etch Channels, and they can be examined using advanced analytical techniques. Studying and analyzing Etch Channels helps us understand the natural processes that occur within the crystals and their impacts on the properties of the diamonds or gemstones. Additionally, Etch Channels can be used to identify the origin of diamonds and gemstones.

Overall, etch channels are valuable information sources for understanding the processes and factors influencing gemstone formation. Analyzing them helps evaluate gemstone properties and value, serving as an essential tool in gemology and geological research


## Gemstone Impurities

Gemstone impurities are intrinsic components that occur naturally or during the formation of gemstones, affecting their color, clarity, and overall value. These impurities, ranging from trace elements like nitrogen and boron to structural inclusions, play a significant role in defining the unique characteristics and beauty of each gemstone. Understanding and analyzing these impurities not only enhance our appreciation of these precious stones but also provide critical insights for gemologists and jewelers in assessing and valuing gemstones accurately.


### Occurrence of Gemstone Impurities

Gemstone impurities form when other elements or compounds become incorporated into the crystal structure of a gemstone during its formation process, typically as a result of the environmental conditions in which the gemstone forms. For example, in rubies and emeralds, chromium (Cr) atoms can replace aluminum (Al) atoms in the crystal structure, resulting in the red color of rubies and the green color of emeralds. In diamonds, nitrogen (N) impurities can cause a yellow hue, while boron (B) impurities can create a blue color[174]. Additionally, certain impurities, such as metals from the growth process in synthetic diamonds, can create internal stress within the crystal, potentially leading to brittleness and a higher likelihood of fracturing[175][166]. Understanding the formation of these impurities helps gemologists accurately identify and evaluate the quality of gemstones.


### Types

Impurities in Diamonds

Boron  is an impurity that causes diamonds to appear blue. This element plays a significant role in creating blue diamonds, such as the famous 'Hope Diamond'[141]

Carbon Dioxide In some cases, diamonds can contain impurities of carbon dioxide and carbonate, leading to absorption bands in the infrared spectrum and affecting the diamond's color[168]

Impurities in Topaz

Chromium gives topaz a pink to violet color, making these stones highly valued and often referred to as Imperial Topaz. Chromium is a crucial element in the coloring process of topaz[176]

Oxygen The combination of oxygen and radiation can turn topaz orange and yellow. This impurity plays a significant role in creating the diverse colors of topaz[176]

Impurities in Sapphire and Ruby

Chromium is the main impurity that causes the red color in rubies and the blue color in sapphires. The presence of chromium leads to the absorption of light in specific ranges, resulting in vibrant colors in these gemstones[177]

Vanadium can impart a variety of colors, such as purple and green, to sapphires and rubies. This element adds interesting and valuable colors to these gemstone[177]

Impurities in Synthetic Gemstones

Synthetic Diamonds Synthetic diamonds produced by methods such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) or High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) often contain impurities like boron and nitrogen, resulting in colors such as blue from boron or yellow from nitrogen[174][174,178][175][166]

Metal Alloys In the synthesis process of synthetic diamonds, metal alloys such as nickel and cobalt are used, which can lead to impurities and unnatural colors in the diamonds[166]


### Examination and Analysis

Infrared Spectroscopy This technique involves passing infrared light through the gemstone and measuring the absorption spectrum. Different impurities absorb light at different wavelengths, allowing for their identification. For instance, boron in diamonds can be detected by its characteristic absorption in the infrared spectrum[174]

Photoluminescence Spectroscopy In this method, a gemstone is exposed to laser light, and the emitted light (photoluminescence) is measured. This helps identify impurities like nitrogen-vacancy centers in synthetic diamonds

Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) This technique uses X-rays to excite the atoms in a gemstone, causing them to emit secondary X-rays. The emitted X-rays are analyzed to determine the elemental composition of the gemstone. For example, iron and cobalt impurities can be detected in synthetic diamonds using EDXRF[166]

Laser Confocal Microscopy (LCM): This method uses laser light to scan the surface and internal structure of gemstones, creating detailed 3D images. It is particularly useful for studying the micro-features and internal structures left by impurities and growth processes in synthetic diamonds[179]

DiamondView: This tool uses ultraviolet light to create fluorescence images of diamonds. It helps in identifying growth patterns and impurities, especially in synthetic diamonds produced by HPHT methods[175][166]

Raman Spectroscopy: This technique uses laser light to measure the vibrational modes of molecules within the gemstone. It is effective in identifying specific impurities and internal structures, such as carbon dioxide and carbonate inclusions in diamonds


### Effects on Gemstone Properties

Color Certain impurities can alter the color of gemstones. For example, boron can cause diamonds to appear blue, while nitrogen gives diamonds a yellow hue Additionally, the presence of chromium and vanadium in rubies results in their red color[141]. Therefore, the type and amount of impurities present determine the color of the gemstone.

Clarity Small particles or gas bubbles as impurities can reduce the clarity of gemstones. For instance, diamonds with impurities are less clear than those without[178]Inclusions of other minerals, such as titanium and iron in rubies and sapphires, can create color bands or cloudy spots that decrease the gemstone's clarity[179]

Durability Impurities can also affect the durability of gemstones. The inclusion of iron and titanium minerals can lead to internal cracks or voids that reduce the gemstone's toughness and structural integrity[174]. Diamonds with impurities are more prone to fractures compared to those without.


### Conclusion

Impurities in gemstones have a significant impact on their beauty and value. Studying and examining impurities is crucial for assessing the properties of gemstones and making informed decisions when buying or selling them. Understanding the types, formation, and effects of impurities allows us to gain a deeper knowledge of the gemstones we admire.

# Lab-Grown


##  Lab-Grown Diamonds

Lab-Grown Diamonds are diamonds that are created in a laboratory rather than mined from the earth. These diamonds possess the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as natural diamonds, making them nearly indistinguishable to the naked eye. The primary difference lies in their origin, as Lab-Grown Diamonds are produced through advanced technological processes, making them more affordable and environmentally friendly than natural diamonds.


### History 

The creation of Lab-Grown Diamonds dates back to the mid-20th century. In the 1950s, researchers succeeded in creating the first synthetic diamonds using the High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) method. Over the years, technology has rapidly advanced, leading to the development of the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method, which allows for better control over the diamond-growing process. These technological advancements have made Lab-Grown Diamonds more accessible and increasingly accepted in the jewelry industry.


### Properties 

Lab-Grown Diamonds have the same physical and chemical properties as natural diamonds, consisting of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal structure, giving them their hardness and durability. These synthetic diamonds can exhibit various colors depending on the elements present during the synthesis process.[180]


### Types 

HPHT Method This method simulates the natural conditions under which diamonds form in the earth. A small diamond seed is placed in a chamber with temperatures exceeding 1,300 degrees Celsius and pressures above 5 gigapascals. Carbon is then added to the chamber, which crystallizes onto the seed diamond, forming a larger diamond. This method can produce diamonds with varying colors and clarity based on the conditions and elements present.[166]

CVD Method This method involves placing a diamond seed in a chamber filled with carbon-rich gases, such as methane. The gases are then ionized into plasma using heat, causing the carbon molecules to break apart and crystallize onto the seed diamond, forming a diamond. This method allows for better control over the properties of the diamond, such as size, shape, and quality.[154]


### Examination and Analysis

Identifying Lab-Grown Diamonds requires specialized tools and expertise. Gemological laboratories, such as the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), use advanced techniques like spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging to differentiate synthetic diamonds from natural ones. Certifications from these laboratories provide consumers with confidence regarding the origin and quality of the diamonds.


### Popularity 

Lab-Grown Diamonds are used in various fields, especially in the jewelry industry due to their beauty and affordability compared to natural diamonds.
